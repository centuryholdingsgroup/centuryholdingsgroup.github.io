Century Local a retail arm of CHG, is a health conscious company with a growing customer base who we care about. That's why our current line of vaping products are made with quality parts and non-tobacco, non-nicotine ingredients.

We serve a higher end clientele who demands quality above cut rate pricing. As such our products are not the cheapest by anybody's definition, but as our customers know nice things, cost money. Our commitment is to continue to build only high end products.   

Century Holdings Group serves the micro to medium B2B markets with software solutions to allow swift adoption and expansion of platform independent e-commerce solutions to consolidate analytic intelligence yield and improve front side sales metrics horizontally, across verticals.
