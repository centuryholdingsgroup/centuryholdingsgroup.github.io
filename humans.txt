This website was hand-made in nano, and github, and firenote in raw text by jeff and tony

The site was made quickly and furiously for the purpose of establishing credibility for merchants before we lose all our customers. it is a desperate bid for survival in an endless effort to simply conduct business. The date is 8-15-2016 it is noon PST and our fit will be decided by square corporation as to whether our latest money will be released and we can commence business transactions henceforth, or whether like the last monumental effort to ramp up corporations and products and customers, all money frozed in the opening minutes. A peculiar trend with this particular project in whatever incarnation. See the silk presentation forthcoming for more details on what that means exactly.
